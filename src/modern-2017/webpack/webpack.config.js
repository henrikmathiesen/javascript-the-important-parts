    Webpack has 4 core concepts
        - entry
        - output
        - loaders
        - plugins

    Webpack devServer: compiled code is kept in memory (not written to disc), this is good for performance

    About sourcemaps: many options, read about them here
        - http://cheng.logdown.com/posts/2016/03/25/679045
        - https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/

    babel and autoprefixer get their options from entry in package.json, other tools might share these options as well

    eslint gets its rules from .eslintrc
    "off" or 0 - turn the rule off
    "warn" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning (doesnâ€™t affect exit code)
    "error" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error (exit code is 1 when triggered)

    prod builds
        - webpack -p from command line
            * runs minification
            * sets NODE_ENV to 'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
                * it converts the object to a string (just like envify), https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/#node-environment-variable
            * NODE_ENV is NOT set within this config file however, so can not check against it here (without setting it again before running webpack)
            * If we want to send parameters to this config, we can do it like we are doing it here in this file and package.json
        - sending parameters into this file is a way to toggle dev/prod builds
        - another alternative is to use 2 config files, webpack.dev.config.js and webpack.prod.config.js, and use either from npm script, but that would lead to duplicate code between the two
        - a third option is to to use 3 config files: a common, a dev and a prod and then merge them. https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/#node-environment-variable
